While using sql alchemy orm with pymysql dialect i faced a authentication problem
where the access to the database was denied everytime when requested.
But at the same time the mysql database was completely responsive and functional when accesed through the terminal interface or via the database workbench like 
Dbeaver coummunity edition.
\\
The main problem was that my password registered in the mysql users database conatained multi special characters.
On closly reading the Sql ALchemy documentation i found that in order to pass special charecters in the password feild i need to convert them or escape
them or parse them in to a differenet format.
for that i used following code : 

import urllib.parse
a=urllib.parse.quote_plus("your password here")
print(a)


take the converted output and pass that mutated string in the password feild in the connection url.
and now the access wont be denied.
